### Hello  ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer based in CzÄ™stochowa, Poland, with a focus on backend development and building data processing pipelines for Big Data and AI purposes. I specialize in Python-related technologies and web frameworks, and I am trying to be an active contributor to the Open Source community.

Throughout my professional journey, my main responsibilities have revolved around backend development. I have gained extensive experience in designing and building robust API systems and data processing pipelines, particularly in the domains of Big Data and AI. I enjoy working with large-scale data and leveraging advanced analytics techniques to extract valuable insights.

With a strong emphasis on problem-solving, I find satisfaction in diving into complex challenges that involve protocols and system intricacies. I continuously seek innovative solutions and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

While backend development is my primary area of expertise, I also have some experience in developing user interfaces using popular frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular. Although this may not be my strongest skill set, I strive to deliver functional and user-friendly UI components.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to discover the projects I have worked on and the technologies I have utilized. If you have any questions or potential collaboration opportunities related to Python, web development, Big Data, AI, cloud platforms, CI/CD, or frontend frameworks, I would be more than happy to discuss them.
